## 1.0.0 (TBD)

* Update to the rust 2018 edition, including the changes to pass all 2018 idiom
  lints (anchored paths, anonymous/elided lifetimes).  _This makes this start
  of the 1.x release series dependent on rust 1.31 (currently beta) and thus
  less stable than prior 0.x releases, which will continue to be maintained as
  needed._

* Separate into its own *barc-cli* crate (see prior history in the *body-image*
  crate).
