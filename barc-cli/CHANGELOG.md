## 1.0.0 (2018-12-04)
* Update to the rust 2018 edition, including the changes to pass all 2018 idiom
  lints (anchored paths, anonymous/elided lifetimes).  _This start of the 1.x
  release series has a minimum supported rust version of 1.31.0, and is thus
  potentially less stable than prior 0.x releases, which will continue to be
  maintained as needed._

* Separate into its own *barc-cli* crate (see prior history in the *body-image*
  crate).
