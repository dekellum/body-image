## 1.0.0 (2018-12-04)

* Update to the rust 2018 edition, including the changes to pass all 2018 idiom
  lints (anchored paths, anonymous/elided lifetimes).  _This start of the 1.x
  release series is dependent on rust 1.31 (currently beta) and thus less
  stable than prior 0.x releases, which will continue to be maintained as
  needed._

* Separate into its own *barc-cli* crate (see prior history in the *body-image*
  crate).
