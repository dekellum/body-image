The _body-image-futio_ crate integrates the _body-image_ crate with _futures_,
_http_, _hyper_ 0.12.x., and _tokio_ crates for both client and server use.

## Minimum supported rust version

MSRV := 1.31.0

The crate will fail fast on any lower rustc (via a build.rs version
check) and is also CI tested on this version.
