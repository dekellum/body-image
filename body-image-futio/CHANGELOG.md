## 1.1.1 (2019-5-8)
* Previously functions `find_encodings` and `find_chunked` were sensitive to
  the order of transfer/content-encoding header value lists, and while the
  ordering is under-specified, had assumed the opposite of documented examples
  in order of _application_, e.g. "gzip, chunked". With this reasonably common
  case, these functions would fail to find `Encoding::Chunked`, since they
  terminated at the first recognized compression encoding.  Fix this by not
  terminating the scan early. Also add support for parsing "x-gzip" as
  alternate for `Encoding::Gzip`, per HTTP 1.1. Finally, handle the edge case
  of multiple compression encodings by using the _last_ (per application order,
  and parsing transfer-encoding before content-encoding) and logging a warning
  of the additional encodings found.

## 1.1.0 (2019-3-6)
* _Error reform_: add `FutioError` enum and remove _failure_ crate dependency:
  * Introduce new `FutioError` enum for the most common error cases. This type
    implements `StdError`, aka `std::error::Error`.
  * Replace `failure::Error`, used for encapsulation of otherwise private
    dependency errors, with compatible
    `Box<StdError + Send + Sync + 'static>`, type-aliased as `Flaw` and in
    `FutioError::Other(Flaw)`.
  * Add `FutioError::UnsupportedEncoding` for use by `decompress` and
    `decode_res_body` for unsupported encodings.  Previously this case was
    treated as if no compression encoding was found.
  * `RequestRecorder<T>` trait methods now simply return `http::Error` for the
    `Err(E)` type. None of the implementations have any other errors and are
    unlikely to have them in the future. Struct `http::Error` is also
    `StdError`, and for convenience and compatiblity, a `From` conversion to a
    `FutioError::Http(http::Error)` variant is included.

  Since `failure::Fail` offers a blanket implementation for `StdError`, which
  includes `Flaw` and `FutioError`, this is graded a MINOR-version
  compatibility hazard. Testing of unmodified dependent crates/projects
  supports this conclusion.

* Function `decode_res_body` now appends `Encoding::Identity` to the
  `res_decoded` list upon success, regardless of if a compression encoding was
  found to decode. This can be used an an explicit indicator that the check
  was made and the associated content-type *should* characterize the current
  `BodyImage`. For a use case, see `barc::CompressStrategy::check_identity` as
  used by the latest _barc-cli_ to avoid double, non-productive compression.

* Upgrade to body-image 1.1.0, for use of `BodyReader` as direct `Read`
  implementation.

* Broaden (optional default feature) _brotli_ dependency to >=2.2.1, <4.

* Improve log and test output via _tao-log_ crate macros.

## 1.0.3 (2019-1-11)
* Upgrade to tokio 0.1.14 and require only the tokio feature flags (and
  sub-crates) that are used. In combination with the latest hyper 0.12.20, this
  avoids unused dependencies: mio-uds, tokio-codec, tokio-fs, tokio-udp,
  tokio-uds.

* Upgrade to tokio-threadpool 0.1.10 for minimal compatibility with the above.

## 1.0.2 (2019-1-4)
* Fix missed upgrade to hyperx 0.14 in prior release.

## 1.0.1 (2019-1-4 _yanked_)
* Upgrade to hyperx 0.14.0 and use new support for faster direct `HeaderValue`
  parsing.

* Simplify find_encodings function.

* Upgrade to hyper-tls 0.3.0 to avoid old minimal versions.

* Upgrade log and lazy_static deps to reflect 2018 minimal versions.

## 1.0.0 (2018-12-4)
* Update to the rust 2018 edition, including the changes to pass all 2018 idiom
  lints (anchored paths, anonymous/elided lifetimes).  _This start of the 1.x
  release series has a minimum supported rust version of 1.31.0, and is thus
  potentially less stable than prior 0.x releases, which will continue to be
  maintained as needed._

* Separate into its own *body-image-futio* crate (see prior history below). As
  of the 2018 edition *async* is a reserved keyword, so substitute *futio* for
  crate name and remaining optional feature and dependency of the *barc-cli*
  crate.

* Upgrade (dev dep) to rand 0.6.1, fix deprecation in benchmark.

* Use this crate's VERSION for default `user_agent`.

## History in *body-image*

Previously *body-image-futio* was released as the *async* module and feature of
the *body-image* crate.  Relevent release history is extracted below:

## body-image 0.5.0 (2018-10-19)
* Drop `async::RequestRecordable` type alias for the `RequestRecorder<B>`
  trait, which was intended to offer backward compatibility (to 0.3.0), but
  wasn't usable. Type aliases to traits can be *defined* but not really *used*
  in rust to date.

* Replace use of "deadline" with "timeout", per the deprecation of the former in
  tokio-rs/tokio#558, which was released as tokio 0.1.8 (and tokio-timer 0.2.6)
  patch releases.

* Replace use of `tokio::thread_pool::Builder` with the new
  `tokio::runtime::Builder` fa√ßade methods. The former was deprecated and the
  latter added in tokio-rs/tokio#645. This was originally released in tokio
  0.1.9. Subsequently tokio 0.1.10 and 0.1.11 were released as (purely semver)
  bug fixes of the former, so make 0.1.11 the new minimum version.

* Use `dyn Trait` syntax throughout. Minimum supported rust version is now
  1.27.2.

## body-image 0.4.0 (2018-8-15)
* The _client_ module and feature are renamed _async_, made a default feature
  and significantly expanded. See the _async_ module subsection below for
  further details. A deprecated _client_ re-export and feature alias remain
  available.

* All internal `Mmap` (*mmap* feature) reads have been optimized using the
  concurrent-aware `olio::mem::MemHandle::advise` for `Sequential` access where
  appropriate. As of _olio_ 0.4.0, this is limited to \*nix platforms via
  `libc::posix_madvise`.

* Remove dependency on the *failure_derive* crate, and disable the _derive_
  feature of the *failure* crate dependency.

* New `AsyncBodyImage` (symmetric with `AsyncBodySink`) implements
 `futures::Stream` and `hyper::body::Payload` traits. The `Payload` trait
 makes this usable with hyper as the `B` body type of `http::Request<B>`
 (client) or `http::Response<B>` (server). The `Stream` trait is sufficient
 for use via `hyper::Body::with_stream`.

* Alternative new `UniBodyImage` and `UniBodySink` implement the same
  traits with a custom `UniBodyBuf` item buffer type, allowing zero-copy
  including when in `MemMap` state, at the the cost of the adjustments
  required for not using the default `hyper::Body` type. (*mmap* feature
  only)

* Both `Tunables` timeouts are now optional, with the initial
  (res)ponse timeout now defaulting to `None`. Thus by default only
  the full body timeout is used in `request_dialog`.

* Replace the only remaining use of `Box<Future>` with `Either` to avoid
  heap allocation.

* Broaden and improve _async_ module tests and catalog by type as _stub_,
  _server_, _futures_, and (non-default, further limited) _live_.

* New benchmarks of `AsyncBodyImage` and `UniBodyImage` stream transfer of
  8MiB bodies, from states `Ram` (also incl. "pregather", as in prior, and
  per-iteration `gather`), `FsRead` incl. various read buffer sizes, and
  `MemMap` (also incl. "pre-" as in prior). `AsyncBodyImage` `MemMap`
  performance is the worst ("stream_22_mmap_copy"), as it combines a copy
  with a cache-busting 8MiB buffer size.  Note that `FsRead` and `MemMap`
  states also benefit from OS file-system caching, as the same file is used
  per-iteration. Results:

## body-image 0.3.0 (2018-6-26)
* Updates to _client_ module for better composability with _tokio_
  applications and fully asynchronous response body support (#2):
  * Upgrade to _hyper_ 0.12.x and _tokio_ (reform, 0.1.x).
  * New `AsyncBodySink` implements `futures::Sink` for `BodySink`,
    supporting fully asynchronous receipt of a `hyper::Body` request
    or response stream.
  * New `request_dialog` function returns `impl Future<Item=Dialog>`
    given a `RequestRecord` and suitable `hyper::Client` reference.
  * Timeout support via _tokio-timer_ and `Tunables::res_timeout` and
    `body_timeout` durations.

* Upgrade (optional default) _brotli_ to >=2.2.1, <3.

* Minimal rustc version upgraded to (and CI tested at) 1.26.2 for use
  of `impl Trait` feature.

* Add thread name/id logging to cli and client integration tests
  (optionally via env TEST_LOG number).

## body-image 0.2.0 (2018-5-8)
* Minor change to use `Dialog::clone` (infallible clone support, #1)

## body-image 0.1.0 (2018-4-17)
* Initial release
